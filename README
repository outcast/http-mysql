-----http-mysql------

I wrote this to allow me to mysql queries via http. I need to achive because I am working service intergration with Google App Engine (GAE).
GAE dose not currently have the ability to remotely connect mysql databases using python. since it returns the results in json it can be use with thing like jquery.

It is highly recommend to use this only over https.

Next Steps
-------------

1. add encrytion
2. add acl controls
3. add support for multiple databases
